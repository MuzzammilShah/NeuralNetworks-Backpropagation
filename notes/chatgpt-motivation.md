Hey there, this is not part of the notes for the project implementation. You can skip this unless you have extra time for a light read and some AI motivation :)

The part of the lecture where the making of Multi-layer perceptron was demonstrated, I didn't understand all of it directly from the video. So I had asked ChatGPT for help, to make the explanation a lot simpler for me, where I tried to break the code into bits and understand it.

I've obviously made those official notes in [[multi-layer-perceptron]]. But during that process, I also received a lot of motivation messages from GPT (Yes, I try to keep the tone conversational when I communicate with my AI - Sue me, I find it useful to get excellent results lmao).

So I thought I'll add the ones I liked here as at the time I am working on this project, ChatGPT doesn't yet support sharing of chats which have images uploaded in it. Plus this really helped to uplift me as I was slowly trying to understand NN better ( Still a beginner now so :) )
