## GUIDE TO THE NOTES SECTION

Make sure to follow these 2 rules before starting with the notes:
&nbsp;

Rule 1- Start from the [A-main-video-lecture-notes](A-main-video-lecture-notes.md) : That is the **master notebook**, it is best and recommended to navigate to the other notes from here. \
Rule 2 - Just follow Rule 1 :)

&nbsp;

*Update: I have modified the links which interconnect the notes (I had taken them down in a format followed in obsidian so). Now all of them are active wrt GitHub. Enjoy :)*
