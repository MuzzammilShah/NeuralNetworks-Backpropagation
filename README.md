## SET 1 - 🔗TRAINING A NEURAL NETWORK


Hello. This is my Notes and Codes repo of training my first neural network. This is obviously from the first video put on this by the main man himself, Andrej Karpathy. \
\
You will find all my notes that I have understood on this in the notes directory. The codes have been broken down into bit-by-bit so that I have a better understanding on them.

&nbsp;

**✍🏻Notes:**
Follow the codes in order if you are revisiting them. Best way is to start from the notes, as the respective notebooks are linked there itself after the explainations. \
There are some useful comments inside the notebooks as well. So make sure you read those as well :)

*See you in the next one!*
