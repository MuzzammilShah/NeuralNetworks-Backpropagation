## SET 1- 1üîóTRAINING A BASIC NEURAL NETWORK


Hello. This is my Notes and Codes repo of training my first neural network. This is obviously from the first video put on this by the main man himself, Andrej Karpathy. \
\
You will find all my notes that I have understood on this in the notes directory. The codes have been broken down into bit-by-bit so that I have a better understanding on them.

&nbsp;

**‚úçüèªNotes:**
Follow the codes in order if you are revisiting them. Best way is to start from the notes, as the respective notebooks are linked there itself after the explainations. \
There are some useful comments inside the notebooks as well. So make sure you read those as well :)

There was an excersise provided by Andrej at the end of the video - [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FPTx1RXtBfc4MaTkf7viZZD4U2F9gtKN?usp=sharing)  
I tried my best to solve it in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sFFKx3GkiOiJ6hHQYCux-3Q2Otl4MZu9?authuser=2).

*Hopefully I understand all of this much much better as I move ahead with this lecture (Right now my loss function maybe a little high :) )*
*But for now, I guess I have been able to **nudge** the values little bit in a more positive direction to improve the loss value. So that's a good sign xD*

*See you in the next one!*
